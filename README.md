# Disassembly Land
---

Just a reference to Assembly alongside with sourcr code and/or pseudocode.

So far, I have only added PE files that are being compiled with gcc with source code written in C. 

Goal is to add as much references between source code and disassembled functions to learn calling convention and to be proficient in identifying data structures, etc,etc.

Whenever there are time, we can add on to the list. Currently, functions are being done.
